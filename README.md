# Hey, I'm Sean Rioux.

I'm a web entrepreneur, programmer, and advocate. I believe in the social
potential of a more open and humane world wide web. 

At the moment I'm in build mode, however, I'm certainly open to discussing
worthwhile projects or causes. If something you see here interests you, it's not
hard to reach me.
