# Hey, I'm Sean Rioux.

I'm a web entrepreneur, programmer, and advocate. I believe in the social
potential of a more open and humane world wide web. Infact, I've made it my
mission.

This is my website where I share my thoughts on the current and future state of
the web. You'll also find my portfolio of contributions and products.

At the moment I'm in build mode, however, I'm certainly open to discussing
worthwhile projects or causes. If something you see here interests you, it's not
hard to reach me.
