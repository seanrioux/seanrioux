Banning bots
Key issue anonymity on platforms
Reported scam accounts are removed from Twitter's active follower accounts for users however these accounts are not otherwise flagged as possible bought activity.

If there's a core issue here it's the lack of desire that Twitter has to actually curb automations under some assumption that under the right circumstances these automations might be used for good of course they've made a business case for this and that's why this perspective perseveres

Note on article structure
For the band all bought article focus predominantly on Twitter and the use of allowance of use of automations API integrations and bots under the auspices of purposes focus on defining the problems specific to Twitter also focus on defining the current arguments and positions of Twitter then baked the case for abandoning the bots as the specific solution

In terms of the specific solution basically creating as much friction as possible so as to prevent the sign up of fake accounts while also ensuring that all methods of posting content through bots or third party automation is flagged and marginalized within the larger set of content

On Twitter actively allowing parody bots to continue, many parody bots are adding to the disinformation discourse even if not immediately harmful way does have the negative side effect of contributing more discourse which is not human in this polluting the actual set of perspectives that might exist within a population. Should and Twitter continue to be a platform that's viable for civil discourse then the discourse should be limited to actual human civil discourse. Doesn't make sense for conversations being had about complicated political issues to be had on the same platform and to coexisting with bots which are able to post parity content which is seemingly human even fooling people.
