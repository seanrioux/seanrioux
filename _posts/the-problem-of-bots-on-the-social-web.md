The social web is inundated with bots engaged in platform manipulation. These artificial users are often programmed to interact in ways that amplify harmful discourse, sow polarization, and as we have seen already this year, invoke real world chaos.

## The scale of the issue

## The ongoing cost of half measures

Despite violent attacks on democracy, and a rising death toll in a global pandemic social media platforms continue to flail, with real world implications:

## Addressing three root causes

Platforms need to begin to act proactively, restrictively, and on multiple fronts to battle manipulation. This means a change to their incentives and business fundamentals and addressing some of the root causes:

### Prioritizing user growth

From the beginning social platforms have prioritized user growth as a key metric, with revenue tied to advertising audience. The endless pursuit of user growth has lead to a general goal of low friction sign-up, a process can be easily automated for most services. This also leads to a possible perverse incentive to ignore fake accounts to inflate growth metrics and hence advertising revenue.

## Limited user verification

In pursuit of low friction sign-up, these services have resisted more effective user verification measures. While platforms has recently begun to encourage two factor authentication or offer voluntary verification programs, for the general user no more than an email is a required to sign-up for most.

### API interaction

As human users of social platforms we use an app or the web interface. An API, (or application programming interface) allows programmers to build software automation to interact with these services. The purpose of a social API is to allow legitimate third-parties to build products on the platform. However, these services can be easily misused for illegitimate purposes. In either case interaction via API is opaque, and as users we have no indication that we are engaging with programmed content or interactions.
