2021-01-19-user-verfication-as-a-method-of-bot-prevention

Social media is inundated with bots engaged in platform manipulation. These bots are programmed to amplify harmful discourse, sow polarization, and as we have seen already this year, lead to real world chaos.

In this series we explore the solution space 



Starting with new registrations and working through all accounts, all social media accounts should be verified, and determined to be held by a specific individual. While services might opt to allow unverified accounts, these accounts should be flagged as unverified (similar to the current Twitter verified badge) to ensure humans are clearly able to delineate between trusted human sources, and possible non-human actors on the platform.

There are a few methods that could be used here (some already in practice for access to certain features) either in tandem or as part of a suite of possible options:

- **SMS based verification:** a user receives an SMS containing a unique code on registration, which they use, in conjunction with their password, to access the service and on every subsequent sign-in (i.e., two factor authentication).
- **Government issued ID verification:** a user submits a photo of a valid government issued ID which is checked for authenticity and uniqueness.
- **Human profile photo verification:** a user must maintain at least one well lit, machine and human identifiable image of their face (ideally matching that of the ID).
- **Peer verification:** a new user may request verification from peers who are verified on the service to confirm their identity.
- **Address verification:** a new user must submit a mailing address to which they have access. The user receives a postcard from the service to that address, which includes return postage. The user signs the postcard, and mails it back confirming their address.
- **Payment with a credit card:** perhaps the least popular, but one of the most effective and trusted methods would be simply to require users to pay, a one time fee, to process a verification (with a credit card in their name). To some these verifications might seem draconian (though most, if not all are already a part of official verification policies). To some they might present privacy concerns. What about users seeking to hide their identities (or example, whistleblowers or other anonymous actors)? To that I would argue, that without a method to properly verify these individuals are who they say they are, that anonymity does more harm than good on these type of platforms.

The traditional news media has long had policies and methods for verifying anonymous sources as trusted, privately, in ways that protect the source but allow them to publish information they assert as truthful. Self published information from anonymous sources is unverifiable, and thus objectively, untrustworthy.

One account per individual If we are to require verification for each account, the natural conclusion is that only one personal account may be held by each human individual. The operative here is personal account, namely that each human user on these services should be presented as such, and verified as such to be trustworthy.

There is, of course, a legitimate use case for engaging via multiple accounts on social media, for example engaging as a business, organization, or a creator. In these cases additional verification measure can be employed. Should the entity hold special designation (for example, they are a registered LLC or hold a trademark) that this special designation can be submitted for verification, and be identified (e.g., as a badge) in the account profile to build trust.

In cases where this is not so, for example when an account is simply for a blog, or other creator without any sort of incorporation of registration of business then the restriction is simple: these accounts can still be maintained, but will lack badges of verification. Once these creators become established and officially designated in some verifiable way they can then apply for verification and improve their standing.

The goal should be that verification, or special badges of designation should indicate trust not truth per se, but traceability back to human actors. In this capacity badges of verification should be prominent, displayed on every post, every profile, every interface.
